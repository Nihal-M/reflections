What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git repositories have a hidden file .git which has all the meta data, that 
includes different versions and commits the user saves, and all the copies
of different versions of the file etc. So an normal directory has to be 
initialized as a git repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
